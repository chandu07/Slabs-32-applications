Implementation of genetic algorithm on a low power microcontroller.

As a part of exploiting the possibilities of performing mathamatics required for Optimal Path Planning and Trajectory optimisation, I've written this code.

It isn't omplete yet, but you can see that with little unfinished alogrithm it can do good job.
